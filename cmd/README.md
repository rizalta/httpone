# httpone

A simple HTTP/1.1 server implementation in Go, created to learn about the inner
workings of the HTTP protocol.

## Description

This project is a hands-on exploration of the HTTP/1.1 protocol, built from the
ground up in Go. It's not meant to be a production-ready server, but rather a
learning tool to understand how requests are parsed, responses are constructed,
and how a basic HTTP server handles connections.

## Features

* Parses raw HTTP/1.1 requests.
* Handles basic routing.
* Constructs and sends HTTP responses.
* Chunked encoding
